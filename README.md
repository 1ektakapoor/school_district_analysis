# Analysis for School District Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was for the school board to take a look at students standardized test scores and funding for a district. The initial analysis completed was done using a file that after the fact showed evidence of academic dishonesty.  In order to uphold state-testing standards, a secondary analysis was done. For the secondary analysis, our point of contact - Maria, requested that we replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while maintaining the rest of the data. Once the data was replaced, we continued with our analysis and noted the impact of the replacements.

## Results
* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
